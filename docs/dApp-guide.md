# Decentralized Applications

As a browser extension, AlgoSigner opens the door for developers to build DeFi applications on Algorand by providing a secure way to add transaction capabilities. This enables developers to initiate transactions and accept ALGOs seamlessly, without jeopardizing the security of their users’ secrets.

For end users, AlgoSigner also makes it easy to use Algorand-based applications on the web. Simply create or import your Algorand account, visit a compatible dApp, and approve or deny transactions — all from within your browser.

DApp users can trust AlgoSigner to:

- Securely store and encrypt account secrets
- Authorize transactions without giving dApps direct access to their keys
- Sign and approve transactions when using dApps

## v2 Signing

With the release of v2 signing, developers coding to the standard will be able to use the same code with any Algorand Wallet.

- Examples of signing with v2 are available in the [dapp examples repo](https://purestake.github.io/algosigner-dapp-example/index.html).
- An interactive transition guide that demonstrates the differences between v1 and v2 signing is available as a link from the dapp examples repo or directly access the [transition guide](https://purestake.github.io/algosigner-dapp-example/v1v2TransitionGuide.html).

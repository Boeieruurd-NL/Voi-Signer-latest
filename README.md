# ![AlgoSigner](media/algosigner-wallet-banner-3.png)

An open-source, security audited, Algorand wallet browser extension that lets users approve and sign transactions that are generated by Algorand dApp applications â€” available for Chrome.

## Chrome Extension Store

The extension is available on the [Chrome Extension Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/algosigner/kmmolakhbgdlpkjkcjkebenjheonagdm)

_This is the preferred solution for end-users, updates will be automatically installed after review by the extension store_

Developers working with dApps may also install directly from the release package, or by downloading the project and building it.

# As of release 1.7.0, AlgoSigner no longer supports incomplete atomic groups signing.

## 1.7.0 Release

### Functionality updates
As part of maintaining the standards set by the Algorand Foundation, we've begun to deprecate some of the older signing methods provided by AlgoSigner.
- Incomplete atomic groups signing is no longer supported.
- v1 Signing (`AlgoSigner.sign()` && `AlgoSigner.multisign()`) will stop being supported in the next major release.
- Preliminary error codes were added to all of the errors that AlgoSigner could provide.

Other changes
- A developer-oriented `Clear Cache` button was added to the Settings menu to help out with certain issues
- Fixed account name sometimes not being visible during signing.
- When signing more than one group of transactions, there's now an Indicator on which group you're currently signing.

### 1.7.1 Patch

- Added support for saving addresses as 'Contacts' for easier re-use
- Added support for importing more than one address from a same ledger device
